# Test Environment Variables Loading

## Test Page Created

I've created a test page to check if environment variables are loading:

**Visit:** http://localhost:3001/test-env

This will show you:
- Whether the Supabase URL is loaded
- Whether the Supabase ANON key is loaded
- Overall status

## What Changed

I've updated `elitebuilders/lib/supabase/client.ts` to:
1. Try to load from environment variables first
2. **Fallback to hardcoded credentials** if env vars not loaded
3. Add console logs to show what's happening

## Check Browser Console

After refreshing the page, open browser console (F12) and look for:
- `‚ö†Ô∏è Environment variables not loaded, using hardcoded credentials` - means .env.local not loaded
- `üîß Initializing Supabase with URL: ...` - shows the URL being used
- `üîß Key exists: true/false` - shows if the key exists

## Expected Behavior

1. Visit http://localhost:3001
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. You should see initialization logs
4. **If using fallback**, you'll see the warning message

## Next Steps

**If you still see 401 errors** after this change:
- The credentials themselves might be wrong
- Or the Supabase project might have been deleted/reset

**If it works** with the hardcoded values:
- The issue is definitely with .env.local not loading
- We need to check how Next.js is configured

## Try This Now

1. Refresh http://localhost:3001
2. Check browser console for logs
3. Try logging in
4. Share what you see in the console

**The hardcoded credentials should work** - if they don't, the Supabase keys might have expired.
