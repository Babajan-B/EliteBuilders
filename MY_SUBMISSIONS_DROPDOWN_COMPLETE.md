- **View all submissions** (default "All Challenges" option)
- **Real-time filtering** with instant updates

## 🎨 UI Components

### **Filter Dropdown** (Top Right)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔍 All Challenges       [24]   │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Build an AI Chatbot     [5]    │
│ Create a Web3 DApp      [8]    │

└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Features:**

### **Stats Dashboard** (Dynamic)
Updates based on selected filter:

### **Empty States**
1. **No Submissions at All**
   - Icon: FileText
   - Message: "You haven't submitted to any challenges yet"
   - CTA: "Browse Challenges" button

2. **Filtered Results Empty**
   - Icon: Filter
   - Message: "No submissions found for the selected challenge"
   - CTA: "View All Submissions" button

---

## 📊 How It Works

### **1. Data Fetching**
```typescript
// Fetches submissions with challenge details
.select(`
  *,
  challenges:challenge_id (
    id,
    title,
    brief_md,
    deadline_utc,
    prize_pool
  )
`)
```

### **2. Unique Challenges Extraction**
```typescript
// Extracts unique challenges from submissions
const uniqueChallenges = Array.from(
  new Map(
    submissionsData
      .filter(s => s.challenges)
      .map(s => [s.challenges.id, { id, title }])
  ).values()
)
```

### **3. Real-time Filtering**
```typescript
// useEffect updates filtered list when selection changes
if (selectedChallenge === "all") {
  setFilteredSubmissions(submissions)
} else {
  setFilteredSubmissions(
    submissions.filter(s => s.challenge_id === selectedChallenge)
  )
}
```
