# ✅ Cache Issue Fixed!

## Problem
The `revalidate` export was causing a conflict with Next.js internal functions.

## Solution
Removed `revalidate` exports from all client components ("use client").

## What's Now Active

### Client Components (No Cache - Using React Query Logic)
- ✅ Home page
- ✅ Competitions page  
- ✅ Dashboard
- ✅ My Submissions
- ✅ Submit form
- ✅ Judge console
- ✅ Sponsor dashboard
- ✅ Admin panel

**These fetch fresh data on every component mount.**

### Server Components (Using dynamic + revalidate)
- ✅ Competition Detail (`/competitions/[id]`)
- ✅ Leaderboard (`/leaderboard`)

**These have:**
```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
export const revalidate = 0
```

### Global Config Added
Updated `next.config.mjs` with:
```javascript
experimental: {
  staleTimes: {
    dynamic: 0,
    static: 0,
  },
}
```

## How Caching Works Now

### Client Components ("use client")
```
Component mounts → useEffect runs → Queries database → Fresh data ✅
Browser refresh → Component remounts → Queries again → Fresh data ✅
```

### Server Components
```
Request → Next.js renders → force-dynamic → Database query → Fresh data ✅
Refresh → Re-renders → Database query again → Fresh data ✅
```

## Restart Server

```bash
cd /Users/jaan/Desktop/Hackathon/elitebuilders
./RESTART_FRESH.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

## Verify It Works

1. Visit http://localhost:3000/competitions
2. Should load without errors
3. Open browser console - see fresh data logs
4. Add a challenge in Supabase
5. Refresh page → New challenge appears ✅

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and working!
