# Check Sign-In Page Supabase Connection

## What I Did

I've added comprehensive debugging to the sign-in page:

1. **On Page Load**: Tests Supabase connection automatically
2. **Status Display**: Shows connection status on the page
3. **Console Logs**: Detailed logs for every step
4. **Error Handling**: Catches and displays all errors

## How to Test

### 1. Refresh the Sign-In Page
Go to: http://localhost:3001/auth/signin

### 2. Check the Page
You'll see a **Supabase Status** box showing:
- "Checking..." (initial state)
- "✅ Connected" (if working)
- "❌ Error: ..." (if failed)

### 3. Open Browser Console (F12)
You should see logs like:
```
🔍 Testing Supabase connection...
🔧 Initializing Supabase with URL: ...
🔧 Key exists: true/false
✅ Supabase connected successfully
📊 Session: No session
```

### 4. Try to Sign In
Enter credentials:
- Email: `babajan@bioinformaticsbb.com`
- Password: `proteins123`

Watch the console for:
```
🔐 Attempting sign in with: babajan@bioinformaticsbb.com
📊 Sign in result: { data: {...}, error: null }
✅ Sign in successful!
```

## What the Logs Tell Us

### If you see "⚠️ Environment variables not loaded"
→ The `.env.local` is not being loaded
→ But the hardcoded credentials should still work

### If you see "🔧 Initializing Supabase with URL: undefined"
→ The fallback is not working
→ Check the browser console for errors

### If sign-in fails with 401
→ Check the actual error message in console
→ Might be: "Invalid login credentials" or "Email not confirmed"

### If you see "❌ Failed to initialize Supabase"
→ JavaScript error in the client initialization
→ Check the error message for details

## Next Steps

After testing, please share:
1. What the **Supabase Status** shows on the page
2. What the **browser console** logs show
3. Any error messages when trying to sign in

This will tell us exactly what's wrong!
