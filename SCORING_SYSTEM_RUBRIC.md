# EliteBuilders - Scoring System Rubric

## üìä Overview

EliteBuilders uses a **5-dimensional weighted scoring system** to evaluate competition submissions. Each submission receives scores across five categories, which are then combined into a final weighted score (0-100).

| **Innovation** | 20% | 0-100 | Novel solutions, creativity |
| **Technical Complexity** | 10% | 0-100 | Stack sophistication, architecture |

**Final Score Formula**:
```
Final Score = (Code Quality √ó 0.25) + (Problem Solving √ó 0.25) + 
              (Documentation √ó 0.20) + (Innovation √ó 0.20) + 
              (Technical Complexity √ó 0.10)
