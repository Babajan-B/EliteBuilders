## üí° Pro Tips

### Customize Competitions

Want to add your own competition? Edit the SQL file:

```sql
INSERT INTO challenges (
  id,
  sponsor_org_id,
  title,
  description,
  brief_md,
  prize_pool,
  -- ... other fields
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(), -- Auto-generate ID
  '99999999-9999-9999-9999-999999999999',
  'Your Competition Title',
  'Short description',
  'Full markdown description',
  10000.00, -- Prize in dollars
  -- ... continue
);
```

### Change Prize Amounts

Edit the `prize_pool` values in the SQL file before running.

### Modify Deadlines

All competitions end 25-50 days from now. To change:
```sql
NOW() + INTERVAL '60 days'  -- Change 60 to any number
```

### Add More Tags

Edit the `tags` array:
```sql
ARRAY['ai', 'your-tag', 'another-tag']
```

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### SQL Migration Fails

**Error: "duplicate key value"**
- Solution: Some competitions already exist. Delete them first:
```sql
DELETE FROM challenges WHERE id LIKE 'c0000%';
```

**Error: "column does not exist"**
- Solution: Run migrations in order (AI fields first, then competitions)

### Competitions Page Not Showing

**Blank page or loading forever**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify SQL migration ran successfully
- Check dev server is running

### Search Not Working

- Clear your browser cache
- Refresh the page (Cmd+R or Ctrl+R)
- Check that competitions have tags
