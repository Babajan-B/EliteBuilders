# Complete Database Setup Guide

## 📋 Overview

This guide will help you set up your EliteBuilders database with ALL required tables, columns, and security policies.

## 🔍 What I Found in Your Database

Based on actual verification of your Supabase database:

### Current Profiles Table
✅ **Columns that exist:**
- id (UUID)
- email (TEXT)
- display_name (TEXT)
- role (TEXT)
- bio (TEXT)
- avatar_url (TEXT)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- github_url (TEXT) ← Good!
- linkedin_url (TEXT) ← Good!

❌ **What's missing:**
- profile_picture_url (TEXT) ← THIS IS CAUSING THE SIGNUP ERROR!

### Invitations Table
❌ **Does not exist yet** - needed for admin panel to invite judges and sponsors

## 🐛 Problems This Fixes

1. **Signup Error** - Missing `profile_picture_url` column
2. **RLS Blocking Inserts** - Profiles table has incorrect security policies
3. **No Admin Panel** - Missing invitations table
4. **Performance** - Missing indexes

## 💊 The Complete Solution

I've created a **single SQL file** that does EVERYTHING:

### What It Does:

#### PART 1: Fixes Profiles Table
- ✅ Adds `profile_picture_url` column
- ✅ Configures RLS to allow signup
- ✅ Allows users to view/update their own profiles
- ✅ Allows admins to update any profile
- ✅ Adds performance indexes

#### PART 2: Creates Invitations Table
- ✅ Creates complete invitations table
- ✅ Stores email, role, token, status
- ✅ Tracks who invited whom
- ✅ Has expiration dates
- ✅ RLS: Only admins can manage invitations

#### PART 3: Helper Functions
- ✅ Auto-updates `updated_at` timestamp
- ✅ Function to expire old invitations

#### PART 4: Verification
- ✅ Shows you what was created
- ✅ Lists all policies
- ✅ Lists all indexes

## 🚀 How to Run the SQL

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor

Go to: **https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vhoarjcbkcptqlyfdhsx/sql**

### Step 2: Copy the SQL

Open the file: **`COMPLETE_DATABASE_SETUP.sql`**

(It's in your `/Users/jaan/Desktop/Hackathon/` folder)

OR copy from below (it's the same):

<details>
<summary>Click to see the complete SQL (or use the file)</summary>

```sql
-- See COMPLETE_DATABASE_SETUP.sql file
```

</details>

### Step 3: Run the SQL

1. Click **"New Query"** in Supabase
2. Paste the entire SQL
3. Click **"Run"**
4. Wait for success messages

### Step 4: Check the Results

The SQL will show you verification queries at the end. You should see:

- profiles table with profile_picture_url column
- invitations table created
- RLS policies listed
- Indexes created

---

## ✅ After Running the SQL

### Test 1: User Signup

1. Go to http://localhost:3001/auth/signup
2. Create a new account with:
   - Name
   - Email
   - Password
   - GitHub URL (required)
   - LinkedIn URL (required)
   - Profile Picture URL (optional)
3. **Expected:** Should work without errors!

### Test 2: Create an Admin User

To access the admin panel, you need an admin user. Run this in Supabase:

```sql
-- Replace with your actual email
UPDATE profiles
SET role = 'admin'
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Test 3: Admin Panel

1. Sign in with your admin account
2. Go to http://localhost:3001/admin
3. You should see the admin panel
4. Try sending an invitation to a judge or sponsor

## 📊 Database Structure After Setup

### Profiles Table
```
id                    UUID (PK)
email                 TEXT
display_name          TEXT
role                  TEXT (builder|judge|sponsor|admin)
bio                   TEXT
avatar_url            TEXT
github_url            TEXT
linkedin_url          TEXT
profile_picture_url   TEXT ← NEW!
created_at            TIMESTAMP
```

**RLS Policies:**
- Everyone can view profiles
- Users can insert their own profile (signup!)
- Users can update their own profile
- Admins can update any profile

### Invitations Table (NEW!)
```
id            UUID (PK)
email         TEXT
role          TEXT (judge|sponsor)
token         TEXT (unique)
status        TEXT (pending|accepted|expired)
invited_by    UUID (FK → profiles.id)
expires_at    TIMESTAMP
created_at    TIMESTAMP
updated_at    TIMESTAMP
accepted_at   TIMESTAMP
name          TEXT
```

**RLS Policies:**
- Only admins can view all invitations
- Only admins can create invitations
- Only admins can update invitations
- Users can view invitations sent to their email

## 🔐 Security Policies Explained

### Profiles Table

1. **SELECT (Read)**: Anyone can view profiles
   - Needed for leaderboards, user lists, etc.

2. **INSERT**: Only authenticated users can insert their own profile
   - `auth.uid() = id` ensures you can only create YOUR profile
   - This makes signup work!

3. **UPDATE**: Users can update their own profile
   - `auth.uid() = id` ensures you can only edit YOUR profile

4. **UPDATE (Admin)**: Admins can update any profile
   - Allows admin panel to manage users

### Invitations Table

1. **SELECT**: Only admins see all invitations
   - Regular users can't see the invitation list

2. **INSERT**: Only admins can create invitations
   - Prevents spam/abuse

3. **UPDATE**: Only admins can update invitations
   - Control over invitation lifecycle

4. **SELECT (Own)**: Users can view invitations sent to their email
   - Needed for invitation acceptance flow

## 🧪 Verification

After running the SQL, verify everything worked:

```sql
-- Check profiles structure
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'profiles'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Check invitations structure
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'invitations'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('profiles', 'invitations')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Signup Still Fails After Migration

Check browser console for detailed error (we added better logging):
```
Error message: [what went wrong]
Error code: [error code]
Error details: [specific details]
```

### Can't Access Admin Panel

Make sure you set yourself as admin:
```sql
UPDATE profiles
SET role = 'admin'
WHERE email = 'your-actual-email@example.com';
```

### Invitations Table Not Found

Make sure you ran the COMPLETE SQL, not just the profiles fix.

### RLS Blocking Everything

Check if policies are created:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'profiles';
```
