# ✅ Dashboard and Navigation Fixed

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Navigation Links ✅
**Problem:** All links were pointing to "/" (home page) instead of the competitions page

**Fixed:**
- "View All" button → Now points to `/competitions`
- "Browse All Competitions" link → Now points to `/competitions`
- "Browse Competitions" button → Now points to `/competitions`
- "Make Your First Submission" → Now points to `/competitions`

### 2. Competition Data Fetching ✅
**Problem:** Using wrong field names (challenge_id instead of id)

**Fixed:**
- Changed `challenge_id` → `id` for competition lookups
- Added fallback for description: Uses `brief_md` if `description` is empty
- Added fallback for end_date: Uses `deadline_utc` if `end_date` is missing
- Fixed ordering: Now sorts by `deadline_utc` instead of non-existent `end_date`

### 3. Recent Submissions Lookup ✅
**Problem:** Challenge lookup was using wrong field name

**Fixed:**
- Changed query from `challenge_id` to `id` for primary key lookup

## How It Works Now

### User Flow:

1. **Login** → User signs in at http://localhost:3001/auth/signin
2. **Dashboard** → Redirected to http://localhost:3001/dashboard
3. **Dashboard Shows:**
   - Welcome message with user's name
   - Stats cards (Total Submissions, Approved, Pending, Average Score)
   - Active competitions (first 6)
   - Recent submissions (last 3)
   - Quick action buttons

4. **Click "Competitions"** → Goes to http://localhost:3001/competitions
5. **Competitions Page Shows:**
   - All 10 competitions from migration
   - Search bar (search by name, description, tags)
   - Filter buttons (Easy, Medium, Hard)
   - Prize pool totals
   - Competition cards with details

6. **Click on Competition** → Goes to competition detail page
7. **Click "Submit Entry"** → Goes to submission form

## Navigation Menu

The dashboard now has a clean navigation menu at the top with these tabs:

- **Dashboard** - `/dashboard` (Overview page)
