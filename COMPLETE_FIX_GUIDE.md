# üéØ Complete Fix Guide - Signup Not Working

## üìä Your Current Situation

Based on your errors:

**Click this link in your browser:**
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vhoarjcbkcptqlyfdhsx/sql/new
```

#### 1b. Copy the SQL

```

**‚úÖ If you see this, the trigger is installed!**

3. This creates profiles for users that don't have them

---

### Step 3: Test Signup (2 minutes)

cd /Users/jaan/Desktop/Hackathon
./START.sh
```

Wait 30 seconds for servers to start.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "must be owner of relation users"

**Problem:** Not using Supabase Dashboard

**Solution:**
1. Close any terminal or database tools
2. Open web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
3. Go to Supabase Dashboard link
4. Paste SQL there
5. See: `EXACT_STEPS_TO_FIX.md`

### Issue: Signup still fails after installing trigger

**Check these:**

1. **Trigger exists?**
   ```sql
   SELECT trigger_name FROM information_schema.triggers
   WHERE trigger_name = 'on_auth_user_created';
   ```
   Should return: `on_auth_user_created`

2. **RLS policies correct?**
   ```sql
   SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies
   WHERE tablename = 'profiles';
   ```
   Should show:
   - Enable read access for all users
   - Enable update for users based on id

3. **Using new email?**
   - Don't reuse email from failed attempts
   - Use fresh email like: `test123@example.com`

4. **Browser console errors?**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look at Console tab
   - Check for different error messages

---

### Issue: Dashboard shows errors after signup

**Check:**

1. **Profile exists?**
   Go to Supabase ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí `profiles`
   Find user by email

2. **User authenticated?**
   Check browser console for auth errors

3. **Old users without profiles?**
   Run `FIX_EXISTING_USERS.sql` to create missing profiles
