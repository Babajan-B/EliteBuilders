# ðŸš€ Quick Fix: Clear Cache & Restart

## Problem Solved
âœ… All pages now run dynamically - no caching!
âœ… Fresh data fetched on every request
âœ… Database changes appear immediately

---

## What Changed

Every page now has:
```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
export const revalidate = 0
```

This forces Next.js to:
- Never cache pages
- Always query database fresh
- Show real-time data

## How to Restart Server (Clear Cache)

### **Option 1: Use the Script (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /Users/jaan/Desktop/Hackathon/elitebuilders
./RESTART_FRESH.sh
```

### **Option 2: Manual Steps**
```bash
cd /Users/jaan/Desktop/Hackathon/elitebuilders

# Stop server (Ctrl+C if running)

# Clear cache
rm -rf .next
rm -rf .turbo

# Restart
npm run dev
```

---

## Verify It's Working

1. **Start server:** `./RESTART_FRESH.sh`

2. **Visit page:** http://localhost:3000/competitions

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Should see "Loaded competitions: [...]" log
   - Check Network tab â†’ queries execute on refresh

4. **Test fresh data:**
   - Add new challenge in Supabase
   - Refresh browser â†’ See new challenge âœ…

## Pages That Will Always Show Fresh Data

âœ… Home (/)
âœ… Competitions (/competitions)
âœ… Competition Detail (/competitions/[id])
âœ… Dashboard (/dashboard)
âœ… My Submissions (/my-submissions)
âœ… Submit Form (/submit/[id])
âœ… Leaderboard (/leaderboard)
âœ… Judge Console (/judge)
âœ… Sponsor Dashboard (/sponsor)
âœ… Admin Panel (/admin)

---

## Common Commands

```bash
# Start fresh (clears cache)
./RESTART_FRESH.sh

# Normal start
npm run dev

# Hard refresh in browser
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
```

---

## Why This Matters

**Before:**
- Add competition â†’ Not showing
- Update submission â†’ Still old status
- Need to restart server constantly ðŸ˜“

**After:**
- Add competition â†’ Shows immediately âœ…
- Update submission â†’ Status updates âœ…
- Just refresh browser ðŸŽ‰

---

## Performance Note

- Pages may load ~10-50ms slower
- Worth it for always-fresh data
- Good for development & real-time apps
- For production, can add strategic caching later

**You're all set! ðŸŽ‰**

Just run: `./RESTART_FRESH.sh`
