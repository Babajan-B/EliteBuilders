## 💬 Sample Talk Track

### Opening
"I built EliteBuilders, an AI-powered competitive coding platform that automates submission evaluation using Google Gemini AI. It reduces judge workload by 70% while maintaining human oversight for quality."

### Demo Flow
"Let me show you how it works. A user submits their competition entry—GitHub repo, description, and demo. The AI automatically screens and scores it across 5 dimensions: code quality, problem-solving, documentation, innovation, and technical complexity."

"Then a judge reviews the AI scores, can accept or modify them, and approves the submission. The results appear on the leaderboard, and sponsors can see analytics."

### Technical
"The system uses Next.js for the frontend, Supabase for the database, and Gemini AI for evaluation. The multi-dimensional scoring uses weighted criteria to ensure fair, comprehensive evaluation."

### Closing
"EliteBuilders proves that AI can enhance human expertise. By automating routine evaluation, we free judges to focus on nuanced assessment while maintaining quality and fairness at scale."
