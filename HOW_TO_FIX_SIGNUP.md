## ✅ What This Does

Creates a database trigger that automatically makes a user profile when someone signs up.

**Before:** User signs up → ❌ Error (RLS blocks profile creation)

**After:** User signs up → ✅ Trigger creates profile automatically → Success!

## 🧪 Test It

1. Go to: http://localhost:3001/auth/signup
2. Fill in the form
3. Click "Sign Up"
4. Should work now! ✨

---

## ❓ Why Did the Error Happen?

You tried to run the SQL somewhere other than the Supabase Dashboard. The `auth.users` table is special - only the Supabase Dashboard has permission to modify it.

**Wrong ways (cause error):**
- ❌ Running in terminal with `psql`
- ❌ Using a database GUI tool
- ❌ Running from Node.js code

**Right way:**
- ✅ Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor (web browser)
