# EXACT STEPS - Follow These Precisely

## ⚠️ If You're Getting "must be owner of relation users" Error

You are running the SQL in the WRONG PLACE. Follow these exact steps:

---

## Step 1: Open Your Web Browser

- Open Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
- **DO NOT use terminal**
- **DO NOT use a database tool**

---

## Step 2: Copy This Link

```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vhoarjcbkcptqlyfdhsx/sql/new
```

**Paste this link into your browser's address bar and press Enter**

---

## Step 3: Log In to Supabase (if needed)

- Enter your Supabase email and password
- You should see the Supabase Dashboard

---

## Step 4: You Should See This Page

**Check you're on the right page:**
- URL bar shows: `supabase.com/dashboard/project/vhoarjcbkcptqlyfdhsx`
- Page says "SQL Editor" at the top
- There's a big empty text box in the middle
- There's a green "RUN" button somewhere on the page

**If you DON'T see this, you're in the wrong place!**

---

## Step 5: Copy the SQL

In VS Code (or your code editor):
1. Open file: `RUN_SIGNUP_TRIGGER_FIX.sql`
2. Click anywhere in the file
3. Press: **Cmd+A** (Mac) or **Ctrl+A** (Windows) to select all
4. Press: **Cmd+C** (Mac) or **Ctrl+C** (Windows) to copy

---

## Step 6: Paste in Browser

Back in your **web browser** (not VS Code, not terminal):
1. Click in the big text box on the Supabase page
2. Press: **Cmd+V** (Mac) or **Ctrl+V** (Windows) to paste
3. You should see all the SQL code appear in the text box

---

## Step 7: Click RUN

- Find the **green "RUN" button** (usually bottom right)
- Click it
- Wait 2-3 seconds

---

## Step 8: Success!

You should see:
```
Success. No rows returned
```

And below that, some output showing the trigger and policies.

**NO ERROR MESSAGES**

## 🚨 Still Getting Error?

### Are You 100% Sure You're Using the Browser?

**Take a screenshot** of your screen showing:
1. The browser window with Supabase open
2. The URL bar
3. The SQL Editor page

If you're using:
- ❌ Terminal (command line with `$` or `>` prompt)
- ❌ VS Code SQL extension
- ❌ Any database tool (pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.)

**Then you're in the WRONG PLACE!**

## 📝 Checklist Before Running SQL

- [ ] I opened a **web browser** (not terminal)
- [ ] I went to **supabase.com** in the browser
- [ ] I logged into my Supabase account
- [ ] I see "SQL Editor" on the page
- [ ] The URL contains: `supabase.com/dashboard/project/vhoarjcbkcptqlyfdhsx`
- [ ] I'm pasting SQL into a text box on the webpage
- [ ] I'm clicking a green "RUN" button on the webpage

**If you can check ALL boxes above, then run the SQL.**

## 🎬 Alternative: Use Screenshots

Since this is critical, let me help you verify:

1. Open browser to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vhoarjcbkcptqlyfdhsx/sql/new
2. Take a screenshot showing you're on this page
3. Then paste the SQL and click RUN

## 🔧 Why This Error Happens

```
Terminal/Local SQL Client          Supabase Dashboard
        ↓                                  ↓
   service_role                      postgres role
        ↓                                  ↓
   ❌ ERROR                            ✅ SUCCESS
```

The `auth.users` table is a **system table**.
Only the **postgres superuser** can modify it.
When you use the **Supabase Dashboard**, it automatically uses the postgres role.
When you use **anything else**, it uses your service_role which doesn't have permission.

## ✅ After Success

Once you successfully run the SQL in the browser:
1. You'll see "Success. No rows returned"
2. The trigger will be created
3. Then test signup at: http://localhost:3001/auth/signup
4. It will work! 🎉
